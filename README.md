# KMC_Project
### This is the minor project of Data Science and Machine Learning projects
- I'm doing project in Mental Health all over the world Data

# Before starting Project
  ## Setup :
    - When I start my project I've to activate venv because venv cannot affect other project when we install
      package or upgrade the version in the current project
    - cmd(according to our projects)
        - Python3 -m venv venv
        - Then venv/Scrpits/activate
    - After that I've create requirements.txt and add the package that I required and install 
     requirements.txt as pip install -r requirements.txt

  ## Data :
    - Extract the data from Kaggle. The dataset are above 90k rows and 10 columns above

  ## Process of Data Science :
    - Data Understanding
      a) Collect initial data
      b) Describe data
      c) Explore data
      d) Verify data quality
    - Data Preparation
      a) Select data
      b) Clean data
      c) Construct data
      d) Integrate data
      e) Format data
    - Modeling
    - Evaluation
